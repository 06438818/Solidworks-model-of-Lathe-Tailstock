# The project focused on designing and modeling a lathe tailstock using SolidWorks. It involved creating the base,
quill, handwheel, and locking mechanism while ensuring precise alignment and smooth movement. The design was
optimized for functionality, ease of use, and manufacturability. Motion simulations were conducted to validate the
mechanism
